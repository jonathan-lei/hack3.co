      <p class="text-muted">Hack3 is a fun, 24-48 hour hackathon made for high school students, both new and
        experienced. During this time you will develop and present a project for cool prizes. Most importantly, you will
        learn new and useful skills that will help you on your computer science journey.</p>

      <h2 class="pt-5 h2">Our Goal</h2>
      <p class="text-muted">In the palm of their hands, students hold a computer a thousand times faster than the
        Apollo Guidance Computer used to land men on the moon. Yet, this incredible power remains mostly untapped. Most
        students use technology solely to consume, not create.</p>

      <p class="text-muted">Meanwhile, instead of bringing positive change, tech
        companies and governments have abused these advances to eliminate consumer independence and avoid giving back to
        the coding community. We need to nurture a new generation of ethic-conscious and determined programmers and give
        them the ability to make change for good. Our aim is to provide an opportunity for aspiring leaders of the tech
        world to bring their own ideas to fruition and create a better world for future generations.</p>
